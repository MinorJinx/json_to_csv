# json_to_csv

Converts part of all json files in the INPUT_DIR directory to csv files following the parameters on row 33. Will use the same filename for the .csv as from the .json

This file must be in a directory along with a folder named "json" which contains the json files. The output directory "csv" will be created at launch.

WARNING: Data will be appended to the .csv file if re-ran.
